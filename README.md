Dear Beachmint,

I've spent the past 3 nights working this problem in Python.  I solved the jewelry app section of the test.  Please view my code within the jewelry app and template folders.

For the first part of the test, in what I called the directory app, I decided to hook up the built-in file system to database references to those files and folders.  In the end, I was able to get a functional model and crud, but still needed to work out several kinks in the program.  So, what I did was add file and folder creation hooks into the objects.  What I need to finish in the program is a function for generating file/folder database objects based on a scan of a user's home directory path.  I think having database objects that reference actual file paths on the system like this will be much more adaptable.

I would need another day or two to finish the directory app.  My code for the directory portion of the exam and the partial tests are in the Directory app and template folders.

I didn't very much about PHP when I received the test on Wednesday night.  I was under the impression that I was expected to do the exam in PHP.  I spent the first 5 days I had with this test watching PHP training videos through USC and lynda.com.  I received the ok to do the app in Python on Monday.  I was told getting this test in this week was very important, so I've done my best with the past 2 days.

Thank you for your time, consideration and opportunity to interview.

Sincerely,
Glen Baker
